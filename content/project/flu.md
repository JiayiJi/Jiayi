This work is mentored by Sasikiran Kandula and [Jeffrey Shaman](http://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/jls106/) in the [Department of Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/environmental-health-sciences-ehs).

My work involved:

1. Analyzing large datasets (~68 million) and exploring machine learning methods in MySQL and R to track real-time influenza incidence combining both diagnostic and virologic data.
2. Comparing and Contrasting different machine learning methods (Boosting, SVM, Random Forest, etc) using cross-validation.
3. Creating clear and compelling reports, visualizations, and interactive apps for collaborators in R Markdown.
