In the summer of 2017, I interned at [Data Sciences & Analytics Group](https://www.pnnl.gov/nationalsecurity/technical/capabilities/computing/data_sciences.stm) at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/). I collaborated with designers and programmers to produce a bio-surveillance web application, which will give real-time risk assessment for each news related to zoonotic diseases. My mentor is [Lauren Charles](https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=8834).
