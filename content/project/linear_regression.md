This is my final project for Spring 2017 course: [P8111 Linear Regression Models](http://jeffgoldsmith.com/P8111/).

#### Abstract

I assessed the relationship between gender and salary using a case from the United States District Court of Houston. Several multiple regression models were conducted and yielded convergent finding: male and female doctors were equivalently paid taking account of other productivity-related attributes. While these results should be reassuring, they would not go very far toward resolving salary discrimination disputes. The difficulties of employing statistical analyses within a politically-charged arena are discussed.
