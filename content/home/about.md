# About me

I joined the [Department of Population Health Science & Policy at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institute-health-care-delivery/tci-biostatistics) as a biostatistician in May 2018. I obtained my MS in Biostatistics from [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/) in May 2018. Prior to switching careers into statistics, I earned my M.D in preventive medicine at [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). My research focuses on statistical computing and graphics, multi-omics integrative analysis, high-dimensional data analysis, Bayesian data analysis and causal inference, with application in genomic and proteomic studies, functional genomics and cancer research.

In my spare time, I like listening to classical musics and watching sports games, reading books, hiking, etc.
