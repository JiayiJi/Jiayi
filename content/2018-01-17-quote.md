I am not a computer scientist. I am a social scientist who uses programming and computational tools to answer my research questions.

The goal of this course is to teach you basic computational skills and provide you with the means to learn what you need to know for your own research. I start from the perspective that you want to analyze data, and programming is a means to that end. You will not become an expert programmer - that is a given. But you will learn the basic skills and techniques necessary to conduct computational social science, and gain the confidence necessary to learn new techniques as you encounter them in your research.

The skill is in breaking up a problem into smaller parts until each part is simple enough to be computed using these basic instructions.

Comments are the what - what is the program doing? Code is the how - how is the program going to do this?

Why setup your R projects this way? There’s a big advantage to the “Github first, then RStudio”" workflow: the remote GitHub repo is now the “upstream” remote for your local repo. In essence, you are already setup to push and pull commits to GitHub. There is no need to set anything else up through the shell or a Git client.
