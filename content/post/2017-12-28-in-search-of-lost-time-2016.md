2017 will gone, and I didn't even have time to write one single blog post. An obvious inference should be, 2017 doesn't exist... <!--more--> 

2017 was a year of struggle for me as a biostatistics master student. I spent most time at school learning statistical theories, which sometimes drove me nuts as I came from pure medical background. I do achieve excellent grades (straight A+) for my courses. But, are the proofs and derivations useful for my future career? It is not a silly question. Lots of my peers also feel the crunch.

Therefore, in 2017, I 

* learned some [Python](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/11307120163),
* read [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) from cover to cover 3 times,
* employed tidyverse packages for my projects (`ggplot`, `dplyr` and `purrr` for analysis and `R Markdown` and `xaringan` for communication),
* learned some concepts of machine learning through the [online courses](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) and the reader-friendly [textbook](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/),
* learned some more concepts of machine learning through the classic [textbook](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) and
* didn't write one single blog post, because all my spare time and coffee making time were simply run out.

I feel much better after one year of burying my head in the sand. Keep tuned, 2018.
